# Entity Extraction from AI Research Papers

This project focuses on the automatic extraction of key entities such as tasks, datasets, metrics, and scores from AI research papers. The extracted information facilitates knowledge consolidation, accessibility, and benchmarking for AI models. This code implements entity extraction using the SciBERT model, fine-tuned on a large dataset of scholarly articles to improve performance and generalization.
